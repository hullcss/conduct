# Code of Conduct
## Pretext
All #hullCSS Members are subject to our Code of Conduct. Any examples in this document must not be
considered an exhaustive list, but any breach will be considered against this code. A Member is defined 
as an attendee of a #hullCSS event, a person(s) holding (or having held) a valid paid membership. Or a 
community member, e.g., non-paid members. We, Our, Us refers to the #hullCSS society. You, Users, 
Members refers to you, the reader. This document uses the following action terms: must, should, must 
not, should not and must accept.
General Conduct
1) Members must keep the chat civil and polite, do not abuse or insult anyone on the discord. 
2) Disagreements, while they may occur, should be resolved smoothly, respectfully, and safely.
3) Members must not discriminate against any other user through, though not exhaustive, their 
gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, age, physical appearance.
4) Members must not post anything NSFW. Full Stop.
5) Members must not post anything sexually insensitive, or anything that can be considered 
radicalisation.
6) Members must not post anything against Discord’s Terms of Service or Hull University Union’s 
Policy on social media. (See end of document)
7) Members must try and keep chat in the relevant channels, we may remove content if it clutters 
another channel.
8) Members must not spam messages, images, or any other content. Content spamming will result 
in mutes and possibly kicks/bans if severe.
9) Members must not misuse Pings (@’ing). Your message will be answered as soon as is
possible. If you feel that the issue is an emergency or you want to tell us something quickly, DM 
a member of the Exec team (Yellow in the Discord Bar).
10) Members must respect the decisions made by any Exec or Mod. If you feel that an action made 
by them was wrong, please contact the exec team directly.
11) Members must not backseat moderate - leave us to do our jobs. If you feel that there is 
something that should be brought to our attention, please DM or ping us (refer to rule 9)
12) Members must not advertise on the Discord server without permission. If you do wish to 
advertise, please contact an Exec member, and get our approval before posting.
13) This server is made by University of Hull students who are affiliated with Hull University Union. 
It is worthwhile noting that this is a public server. Treat everything you post here as if it is public 
information. (Members must not post sensitive information)
14) All Members must accept that breaking any of these rules may result in timeouts, mutes, kicks, 
and even server bans or event/social bans (including Permanent Bans).
15) Members must not make exclusionary jokes, even “ironically.”
16) Members must not harass another member, Exec, Mod either in person, on Discord, during 
events or at any other point.
a. https://respectyourself.info/sex/consent/enthusiastic-consent/ is harassment, or even 
abuse.
b. Clothing or flirting are not necessarily consent. If you are asked to stop, stop. If in 
doubt, ask the other person.
17) Members must not display aggressive behaviours, including elitism. Knowledge should be 
shared; it is not a competition.
18) Members should choose your words carefully. This is a professional environment; you never 
know who is listening.

### Alcohol & Sober Social Rules
1) Events may be run where alcohol is available.
2) Members must not encourage or pressure other members into drinking of any amount.
3) Members must accept that if they become overly intoxicated, and/or become a major 
disruption, they will be required to leave the event.
a. Members should not arrive to an event intoxicated. 
4) If an event is marked as a “sober social” or as a “strictly no alcohol” event, Members must not
arrive under the influence of any alcohol. Members must accept that they will be denied entry
to the event if they arrive intoxicated.
### Member Protection
1) Members should ask about gender rather than assuming, and if you get it wrong, please
apologise. Mistakes happen; however, Members should use the person's personal pronouns
when addressing or discussing them.
2) People's private lives are their own. Members must not share details about others that they 
have not explicitly made public (i.e., doxing). This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, 
gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship, or financial status.
3) Members must not take photos of others without their permission. They are entitled to their 
privacy.
4) Members must accept that other members are entitled to their opinion. Speech is free and there 
are no wrong questions, but Members must keep it considerate and respect someone’s right to 
refuse to answer.
5) Members must not damage other members' property. This includes, but is not limited to, 
physical, intellectual, or reputational.
6) Members must not engage in academic misconduct through #hullCSS events or Discord server.
### Consequences
Members must accept that an Exec or Mod’s decision is definite and can be queried or a review
requested into the matter. Execs and Mods must ensure that they do not action unreasonably and/or 
use their position of power inappropriately.
### Warnings
It's always better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the code of 
conduct before it does so.
As such, a warning will be issued.
Any warnings issued should be reported to the Exec, or at hullcss@hull.ac.uk.
* Request to Leave
  * If we are running an event and need to remove you for the wellbeing of the community, we may 
  ask you to leave.
* Requirement to Leave
  * If you refuse to leave, and continue to remain disruptive, you will be removed from the event. 
  This will be enforced using the University Security, or by the venue staff.
* Termination of Membership
  * In extreme cases we may feel it necessary to remove community members who are abusive or 
  aggressive. This will be done through the official University and University Union channels, and 
  in extreme cases may be reported to the police
  
## Questions & Concerns
Questions can be referred to hullcss@hull.ac.uk, the @Exec ping on Discord or DM an Exec.
